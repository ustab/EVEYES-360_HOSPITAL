🏥 EVEYES 360: Hospital 1 Phase – Next-Gen Patient Management System I am proud to share the latest milestone of my project, EVEYES 360, which bridges the gap between 13th-century Seljuk medical wisdom and modern Artificial Intelligence.

🚀 Key Features of the System: Biosonology & Reactive Music Engine: A core module that analyzes real-time biometric data to trigger specific Seljuk Makams. By utilizing the healing frequencies (e.g., 432 Hz, 528 Hz), the system aims to stabilize cellular stress levels during patient admission.

HEIDI AI (Health Intelligence & Diagnostic Interface): Our clinical analyzer performs non-contact thermal scanning (rPPG) and physical posture analysis. It can detect critical vitals like high fever or pain zones instantly.

LegalVault Encryption: Every patient-doctor dialogue is autonomously encrypted and archived with a pre-defined "deletion date" to ensure maximum privacy and compliance with international health regulations.

Multilingual Intelligent Routing: A language-agnostic interface that detects the patient's language and status (VIP/Standard) to streamline the clinical workflow.

🧬 The Vision: EVEYES 360 is not just a hospital management software; it is a Holistic Healing Ecosystem. By integrating the effects of sound on living cells with cutting-edge AI diagnostics, we are digitizing the "Darüşşifa" (Healing House) spirit for the 21st century.
